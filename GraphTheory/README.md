# BIRS Computational Teaching and Learning Workshop

This folder contains drafts of sage jupyter notebooks for use in a 2nd-year course in discrete mathematics, designed by Lucas Mol.  We are planning to start with assessments on the following topics.
- Constructing graph objects and using built-in functions
- Minimum weight spanning trees (Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm)
- Shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm)

Later, we may add assessments on some of the following topics.
- Lists and sums (counting derangements and onto functions)
- Generating functions (extracting coefficients, finding partial fractions decompositions, etc.)
- Recurrence equations (defining recursive sequences, solving recurrence equations)
- Network flows and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
- Matchings in bipartite graphs
